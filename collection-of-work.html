                    <h2>Brain on Fire</h2>
                    <p>The idea for this project came to me at my
                        cottage, where I remembered fireworks and
                        sparklers from the previous years Canada
                        day. One night, I went to the darkest place on
                        the property, lit up sparkles and performed
                        various movements to create symmetrical
                        images. The results were terrific - I got many
                        interesting photos - but this image was the
                        best. It immediately caught my attention as it
                        reminded me of the image of the human
                        brain firing neurons. I am very happy with
                        the final result.</p>

                    <h2>Gray Day</h2>
                    <p>I made this piece called “Gray Day” for a photography assignment on grids. Our task was to
                        create a grid collage of a certain theme while staying inside the school.
                        I took various images of the building and classrooms, but ultimately, I decided to create a
                        collage
                        featuring another student in my class. I made various shots of him around school, and while
                        doing it, I decided to incorporate the mask to highlight that the work was done during the
                        pandemic. The mask also allowed me to express further the mood of that day, which was sad,
                        dark and wet.</p>

                <div class="item3"><img src="images/IMG_6372.JPG" alt="Low Key Photo" width="65%">
                    <h2>Low Key Tech</h2>
                    <p>This image, "Low Key Tech" is a delightful
                        exploration into low-key photography with a laptop as the subject. Rapidly, I discovered the
                        nuanced
                        artistry of low-key techniques, particularly in the context of inanimate objects. Experimenting
                        with
                        various angles and lighting setups, I sought to capture the essence of the laptop in a
                        compelling manner.
                        Employing subtle adjustments and creative flair, I accentuated the laptop's features to evoke a
                        sense of mystery and allure. After several shots, I finally achieved the desired effect, where
                        the laptop
                        emerged as a captivating focal point amidst the shadows.

                    <h2>Negative Space</h2>
                    <p>"Negative Space" is a photograph that holds significant meaning for me, capturing the essence of
                        exploring negative space within art. Taken at a museum, the image features a striking statue
                        enveloped
                        in shadow, with the surrounding emptiness serving as the focal point. Through this image, I
                        aimed to evoke a sense of
                        wonder and introspection, prompting appreciation for the beauty of simplicity and the power of
                        suggestion in artistic expression.

                    <h2>High Key Duo</h2>
                    <p>This image, “High Key,” is another one of my favourites.
                        I really enjoyed experimenting with different equipment
                        to create high and low-key photos. Very quickly, I realized
                        that high-key ptotography was a great way to portray people.
                        I asked two students from my class to step into the shot and try different poses together.
                        After several attempts, I realized that although the images looked good, they lacked interest.
                        I asked one of the students to add some paint to his face to make it stand out. After about
                        three shots,
                        I knew I had got the right one.</p>
